# Errgo Code Assessment
This repo contains two directories:
1. Backend
2. Frontend

There are multiple `TODO`s scattered across both directories. The goal is to complete the TODOs to implement a full round trip scenario to populate and display the data on the front end. It's recommended to start with the `Frontend` directory to get a better understanding of the project and to help determine the necessary code to be added in the `Backend` directory.

Work will be graded taking into account the following aspects:
- Clean code
- Conciseness of solution
- TSDoc

Please read the respective `README.md` files found in each directory for more details.

# Submission
